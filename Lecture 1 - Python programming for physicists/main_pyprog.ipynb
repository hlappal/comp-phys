User-defined functions can be used on lists and arrays as with any standard function, but check carefully they behave as you expect.

    "The use of *Pythonic* methods to vectorize function calculations offers some very efficient methods for creating, handling and plotting density-like functions. Let's consider the waves generated from dropping a pebble into a pond, modelling them as the spreading out in the form of a `sine` wave. If the centre is at $(x_1,y_1)$, then the distance $r_1$ from the centre to a point $(x,y)$ is:\n",

    "$r_1 = \\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2}$\n",

    "\n",
    "$h_1(x,y) = A_0 sin(kr_1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A_0$ is the amplitude of the waves and $k$ is the wavevector, $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can consider dropping a second pebble (exactly the same size and behaviour) at $(x_2,y_2)$ and assume that the waves will add linearly (a reasonable assumption for small waves), then the resultant height at $(x,y)$ will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h(x,y) = A_0 sinkr_1 + A_0 sinkr_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the wavelength, $\\lambda$, is 5 cm, the amplitude, $A_0$, is 1 cm and the centres of the impact circles are 20 cm apart, then we can create a programme to visualize the resulting interference pattern."

    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is based on several useful ideas:\n",
    "* Often types of data and the things you might want to do with that data (\"methods\") are are intimately related, so it makes sense to bundle the data and the methods together into what are called objects.\n",
    "  * For example, a list-type object has list-type data (the elements of the list) and list-type methods such as appending a new element to the list.\n",
    "  * In Python we can assign a list-type object to the variable `mylist` and supply the data by writing `mylist = [2,4,6]`. Then, we can carry out the list-type method of appending the new element 8 to this list-type object by writing `mylist.append(8)`.\n",
    "  * This is the syntax used for OOP in Python:\n",
    "    * To carry out a method for an object: `object.method(...)`\n",
    "    * To access data for an object (we don't do this with lists, but there are examples of this below):`object.item`\n",
    "  * Together, the methods and data items of an object are called its attributes.\n",
    "* Objects fall into classes, all of which have the same methods and the same type of data, although each \"instance\" of a class typically has its own data.\n",
    "  * Thus, every list-type object can use the append method, but every list-type object has its own data (its own list elements).\n",
    "* A programming language like Python with OOP features allows you to create your own classes and define their methods and data items. It also allows you to make a new class by adding to or modifiying an existing class using \"class inheritance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Some languages like C do not have OOP features. Other languages like Java are completely based on OOP. Still other languages like C++ and Python can be used both for OOP and for non-OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a simple user-defined class: Bug\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define the class Bug, meant to represent a firefly (lightning bug) that can make flashes of light. By convention class names are capitalized to distinguish them from variables and functions, which should be spelled in lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of new class starts with class `Name:` where `Name` is the name of the class, and includes all of the indented code below this line. Within the class definition, methods are created by ordinary function definitions, except that the first argument of every method definition is `self`. This \"extra\" argument is not supplied when the method is called (see examples below)."

The shift direction is chosen to speed the bug up if it is more than halfway through the cycle that ends in a flash, otherwise to slow the bug down. This will gradually shift the clock of the bug until it is lit up at the same time as most of the other bugs that it sees.
